## About JustThree

- JustThree is a simple reminder & ToDo app built for people who are overwhelmed by too many Todos and reminders for their every day life, want to get out of the todo hell, and just focus on the essential.
- JustThree is aimed to let the user focus on their essential by displaying just three items on the main view, as simple as possible with satisfying animation.
- JustThree stores user's reminder or todo data only in user's device, using `UserDefaults` with coded saving key.
- With the goal of experiencing whole process from the start of the project to the launch, not only development, but also planning and design were carried out directly.
- Develop with `UIKit` using `Programmatic` way, in MVC pattern.

## What I Learned

#### From start to release

> - **Period**: 18 September 2022 - 6 October 2022 (17 days)
> - **Time Taken**: 50 hours (Design + Development + Release)

- Planning
    - How to decide minimum requirements for app.
    - How to build and optimize the time table.
    - How to meet the deadline for progress.

- Design
    - How to make AppIcon.
    - How to choose a color palette.
    - How to design an app.

- Development
    - How to build UI with `UIKit` using `Programmatic` method.
    - Better understanding of `MVC` pattern and how to implement it.
    - Better understanding of `extentions` in project module.
    - Better understanding of `Data Source` and how to use `Diffable Data Source` in iOS project.
    - Better understanding of `UIView configuration` and how to implement it.
    - Better understanding of `UICollectionView` with `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout`.
    - Better understanding of `accessibility` APIs that iOS support.
    - How to use `CAShapeLayer` and `CABasicAnimation` to make animations.
    - How to reduce CPU usage of the application and enhance the performance.
    - How to save and load data and store user data in `UserDefaults`.
    - How to find the memeory leaks in Xcode project.

- etc.
    - `[weak self]` is essential to prevent the memory leak in app, keep in mind and understand.
    - Still, selecting the color is way much stressfull than I expected.
    - Being a regular user of the app has a big impact on the motivation for developing the app.
