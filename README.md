Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory, or can be placed in the `src/assets` directory, if you prefer.

> We recommend that local images are kept in `src/` when possible so that Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them. Files in the `/public` directory are always served or copied into the build folder as-is, with no processing.
>
> Your local images stored in `src/` can be used by all files in your project: .astro, .md, .mdx, .mdoc, and other UI frameworks. Images can be stored in any folder, including alongside your content.
>
> Store your images in the `public/` folder if you want to avoid any processing or to have a direct public link to them.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
